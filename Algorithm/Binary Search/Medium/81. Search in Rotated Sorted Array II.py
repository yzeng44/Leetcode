'''
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,0,1,2,2,5,6] might become [2,5,6,0,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return true, otherwise return false.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: false
Follow up:

This is a follow up problem to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, where nums may contain duplicates.
Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

Solution:

class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> bool:
        N = len(nums)
        l, r = 0, N - 1
        while l <= r:
            while l < r and nums[l] == nums[r]:
                l += 1
            mid = l + (r - l) // 2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return True
            if nums[mid] >= nums[l]:
                if nums[l] <= target < nums[mid]:
                    r = mid - 1
                else:
                    l = mid + 1
            elif nums[mid] <= nums[r]:
                if nums[mid] < target <= nums[r]:
                    l = mid + 1
                else:
                    r = mid - 1
        return False
